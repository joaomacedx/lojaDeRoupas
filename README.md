  <p>Project referring to the work of completion of the subject Course materials Programming of computational solutions taught by Professor Artur Kronbauer, at <a href="https://www.unifacs.br">Salvador University</a>.</p>
   General description
In this project, a system will be created with functionality for registering and managing records. O
context/theme of the system to be developed is freely chosen by the team.
This project will be worth up to 10 points, which will be used to calculate the general average for the semester
of this Curricular Unit.
This project will be delivered in two stages that will be defined below.
This is a group project. It must be carried out by teams of a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 5
members. Exceptions will only be accepted in exceptional cases.
Requirements
Delivery P1:
1. The system must be developed in Java. Failure to meet this requirement will result in a score of 0
on the project as a whole.
2. The system should allow recording of objects of a class (eg employee, product, service...). A
class must have at least 5 different attributes.
3. The system should allow listing of registered objects, displaying results in tabular format
with only 3 of the objects' attributes.
4. The system should allow searching and displaying of one of the records based on one of its attributes. A
display should show the 5 different attributes.
5. The user interface must be textual, presenting menus with options such as: register,
list and exit.
6. When running the program, it should automatically register at least 7 objects. Those
objects will be useful for testing the program.
7. The main program execution class must be called Program.java.
8. The system must store the objects in a data structure (eg array, ArrayList...)
9. The program should have comments describing what the program is supposed to do, what each class
and each method should do and what the main lines of code do. The names given to
variables, classes and methods must be self-descriptive.
